I suppose I can do a little research about the subject – I've had a lot of fun with this – but for now, let's focus on my findings. In fact, what I found surprising was that, unlike most people I met, most of them did not know anyone who drank wine, at least not at the time – they just never considered it important or appreciated its beauty or purity.
